## Install

This workflow is a subcommand of the [msar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msar) tool, which can be installed using `npm` (or your preferred equivalent):

```bash
npm install -g msar
```

It depends on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) which provides the `npm` package manager tool when installed.
